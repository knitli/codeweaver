# Community Expectations

CodeWeaver welcomes everyone. Everyone deserves a place to contribute, share, help, and build. Your age, gender, race, disability, sexual orientation, or identity do not change this.

## What You Should Do

- Respect how people want to be treated
- Assume good intent from others
- Value different perspectives and experiences
- Take responsibility for your actions
- Give and receive feedback with respect
- Help strengthen the community
- Disagree professionally when needed

## What You Should Not Do

- Harass anyone or contact them in ways they've asked you not to
- Insult, demean, or make unwanted comments about someone or a group
- Make assumptions about people based on their background or identity
- Make sexual comments or advances toward anyone in the community
- Share someone's personal information without their permission
- Threaten or promote violence
- Act in ways that harm the community

## If You Make a Mistake

- Acknowledge what you did
- Fix it
- Accept the consequences

## How to Report a Problem

1. Talk directly to the person involved
2. Email Adam at <adam@knit.li> (even if Adam is the problem—he wants to know and fix it)
3. Post in the discussion board if the issue affects the whole community (examples: "I've seen this behavior and here's why it's a problem" is appropriate; "Person X did something bad" is not)

When in doubt, email Adam.

## Consequences

Consequences depend on what happened, why it happened, and how serious it was. Adam makes the final decision.

Possible consequences:

- A private conversation
- A formal warning
- Temporary limits on participation
- Permanent removal from the community

## Where This Applies

- Any interaction with community members
- Anytime you represent the community
- For serious violations of community values, consequences may apply regardless of where the behavior occurred
