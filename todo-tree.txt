   │  └─ line 11: TODO : The plan for this script is to make it an overall dev helper to do things like:
   ├─ generate-delimiters.py
   │  └─ line 19: TODO : I'm fairly sure we aren't using this anymore, and instead we construct them dynamically
   ├─ doctor.py

   ├─ index.py
   │  └─ line 53: TODO : Add admin endpoint in future for manual re-index trigger
   ├─ provider.py
   │  └─ line 119: TODO : We need to allow for dynamic providers in the future, we would check if there's a provider class registered for the value, then register the provider here with `cls.add_member("NEW_PROVIDER", "new_provider")`.
   ├─ services.py

   ├─ normalize.py
   │  ├─ line 26: TODO : Add Rebuff.ai integration, and/or other advanced sanitization options. Probably as middleware.
   │  └─ line 52: TODO : Need to add a mechanism to override or customize the injection patterns.
   ├─ logging.py
   │  └─ line 207: TODO : Once they become more available, we should use `raw template strings` here
   ├─ mcp.py
   │  └─ line 63: TODO : add icon
   ├─ settings.py
   │  └─ line 316: TODO : flatten the config structure. It's a bit too much when using env vars for nested models, particularly for provider settings.
   ├─ types.py
   │  ├─ line 56: TODO : Replace most defaults with Unset, to better track user-set vs default values. We just need to ensure we don't pass Unset to places that don't accept it. I'm not sure what the best way to do that is yet. My thought is that we could possibly modify pydantic serialization to convert Unset to None or missing values, but *not* do that for telemetry serialization.
   │  └─ line 172: TODO : We should add hot reload, but we need to manage handling it mid-request.
   ├─ discovery.py
   │  └─ line 183: TODO : A better approach for files that we can semantically analyze is to hash the AST or structure instead of the raw file contents and compare those.
   ├─ language.py
   │  ├─ line 365: TODO : Validate the `dependency_key_paths` for each config file to ensure they are correct. If you use these languages, please let us know if you find any issues with the `dependency_key_paths` in the config files. Some are probably incorrect.
   │  └─ line 1493: TODO : Integrate into indexing and search services to use these languages.
   ├─ metadata.py
   │  └─ line 111: TODO : Logic for symbol extraction from AST nodes
   ├─ enum.py
   │  └─ line 39: TODO : For our larger enums with lots of property methods, like `SemanticSearchLanguage`, it probably makes sense to define it as an enum with type `dataclass` members, where most of the properties are defined on the dataclass, and the enum just holds instances of that dataclass. This would make it easier to manage and extend the enum members. See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/enum.html#dataclass-support. This would also make it easier to add new members without having to add the member to the enum methods themselves. Since attributes and properties are accessed the same way, we could do this without it being a breaking change. Classes that would benefit from this treatment:
   ├─ delimiter.py
   │  └─ line 1237: TODO : Implement proper conversion when delimiter families are integrated
   ├─ registry.py
   │  ├─ line 33: TODO : Make size_limit configurable by users in settings.
   │  ├─ line 35: TODO : Should we make `EmbeddingRegistry`'s size dynamic based on conditions? For example, if we are getting service errors from the vector store, we could increase the size_limit temporarily as a queue.
   │  └─ line 37: TODO : Save the store to disk to persist across restarts. Ideally we'd use a contextmanager to load/save the store automatically. The parent class, `SimpleTypedStore` already has `load` and `save` methods we could leverage.
