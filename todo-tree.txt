   │  ├─ common
   │  │  ├─ utils
   │  │  │  ├─ git.py
   │  │  │  │  └─ line 119: TODO : (big one): This is a precursor for future functionality. We'd like to be able to associate indexes and other artifacts with a specific git commit. Because there's nothing worse than an Agent working from a totally different context than the one you expect. We need to track changes across commits, branches, etc. This is a first step. We'll need to figure out how manage partial indexes, diffs, etc. later.

   │  │  │  └─ enum.py
   │  │  │     └─ line 39: TODO : For our larger enums with lots of property methods, like `SemanticSearchLanguage`, it probably makes sense to define it as an enum with type `dataclass` members, where most of the properties are defined on the dataclass, and the enum just holds instances of that dataclass. This would make it easier to manage and extend the enum members. See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/enum.html#dataclass-support. This would also make it easier to add new members without having to add the member to the enum methods themselves. Since attributes and properties are accessed the same way, we could do this without it being a breaking change. Classes that would benefit from this treatment:
   │  │  ├─ discovery.py

   │  │  │  ├─ line 1398: TODO : Integrate into indexing and search services to use these languages.
   │  │  │  └─ line 1437: TODO : We included the langchain dependency before we got ... carried away ... with our own chunkers. Ours are much more robust. We'd need to improve markdown handling, but otherwise, we can probably drop the langchain dependency and remove this chunker.
