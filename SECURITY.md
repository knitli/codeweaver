# Security

CodeWeaver is **beta** software. It may have bugs and vulnerabilities, and we do not provide support for any version except the current release.

Beta software has bugs, probably lots of them, and some of those may be security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Security Concern

If you think you identified a possible security vulnerability, or otherwise have a security concern **please report it using [Github security advisories at this link](https://github.com/knitli/codeweaver-mcp/security/advisories/new).**

That will help keep us all a little safer, thanks!
