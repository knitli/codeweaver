"""Data package for CodeWeaver containing node types and cached grammar data.

This package is primarily generated during the build process and should not be
edited directly. Its main member is `node_types_cache.pkl`, which is the cached compiled grammar data used by CodeWeaver's semantic processing components. The raw node type definitions are also included as a backup in the `node_types/` directory.
