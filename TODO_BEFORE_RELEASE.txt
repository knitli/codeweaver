1. Incorporate new codeweaver.config.envs into settings resolution (codeweaver.config.settings and related modules)

2. Use pydantic models to produce most of the input for server.json and tools.json dynamically to minimize risk of drift (new work in scripts/_models and work refining the find_code tool)
    - produce flags by querying cyclopts directly or inspecting the function signature

3. Finish cleaning up find_code

4. double-check Docker variables
